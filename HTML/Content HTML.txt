Some Quotations of M. Ali Jinnah


"Think 100 times before you take a decision, But once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man."

Expect the best, Prepare for the worst.

I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and make it right.

My message to you all is of hope, courage, and confidence.
